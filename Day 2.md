Day 2 in Adventures of FBO Ownership

Today's freelance job is flying a fully loaded Cessna Carvan from Chicoutimi
(CYRC) to Quebec City (CYRB). The scenery is kind of ugly actually; the snow is
gone but the world has yet to turn green; I'll have to make this run again in
the fall.

Safely settled into the New England Flight Support's Pilot's Lounge after the
flight, I finally get a chance to pull out the atlas. My prize was two
airfields: [98KS](https://server.fseconomy.net/airport.jsp?icao=98KS) Montezuma
and [6KS1](https://server.fseconomy.net/airport.jsp?icao=6KS1) Quinter, which
RoscoHead said were about 100nm apart. I plug the two into FSEconomy's (FSE)
[trusty mapper](http://www.gcmap.com/mapui?P=6KS1-98KS&MS=wls&DU=mi), but it
tells me the two are 250 miles apart! Something is off.... After much digging,
it seems the FAA reassigned the 6KS1 code to a hospital helipad across the
state from Quinter. The good news is that the 6KS1 physical operations (like
landing!) can be easily transferred to the nearby
[1QK](https://skyvector.com/airport/1QK/Gove-County-Airport), still in Quinter.
I know the FSE Board of Directors (BoD) has a strong policy against updating
the conical name of airports, but I wonder if anything can be done to fix the
mapping....

Next up is to figure out planes. If I just have the two airfields (and don't
expand), a small plane with 2 or 3 seats (like the Cessna 152) is just about
right. I found a 152 down in Mississippi that proved to be a super cheap
rental, or there's one for sale for ~$75k in the Alaskan panhandle. And I need
to figure out how to get me there...seeing as I don't currently have a plane at
all!

To be continued...
